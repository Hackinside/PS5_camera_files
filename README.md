# Instructions:

1. Download the files from my GitHub page. 
2. If you have already installed the PS4 camera driver, skip this step. Otherwise, run the InstallDriver.exe program first.
3. Connect the PS5 camera. On the Device Manager, You will see the USB BOOT under Universal Seria Bus Devices.
4. Make sure that the OrbisEyeCameraFirmwareLoader.exe is in the same folder as firmware.bin and run it. 
5. Back to the Device Manager under Cameras should be showing USB Camera-OV580

Done. Now you can use it on most webcam software. 
Need to repeat step 4 every time you disconnect the camera for the PC.
